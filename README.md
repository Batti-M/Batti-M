- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Batti-M

I'm a selftaught webdeveloper who is looking for a chance to show his skills.
Over the past months i learned HTML,CSS and Javascript while working full time for the Deutsche Post in TÃ¼bingen.
Currently I'm learning React because i'm aiming for a job as React developer.
Because Typescript is working well with React, that's something i aim to learn in the near future.

Over the past few months coding became a hobby and who doesn't want to make his hobby his working place,right? ;)

Check out my website <a>bartosz-mieszkalski.de</a> and reach out to me if you're interested in a passionate new employee
